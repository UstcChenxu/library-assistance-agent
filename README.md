# library-assistance-agent

Our team is developing an intelligent library assistance agent that can help users in finding and accessing books, as well as providing recommendations and answering questions related to the library. The software will be hosted on GitHub and accessible through a web application.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47934017/224872769-8d00fc9a-213a-43f1-90bc-7e6a1cd9a81c.png)
